copy content of ```json-generator.txt``` and visit ```https://www.json-generator.com/```.
execute it and get your generative data.

you can restore you generative data in ```result.json```.

if you performed data generation, so rename ```executer.slot.ts``` to ```executer.slot.inactive.ts```.
**rename** ```executer.slot.inactive.ts``` to ```executer.slot.inactive.ts``` only if you **deleted your database before** and rerun ```npm start```!
